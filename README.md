# Tic Tac Toe

This is a simplified text based version of the game "Tic Tac Toe" where two players will play together on the same command prompt.

# Instructions

The user will be prompted to enter a letter that will indicate where they want to place their maker ('X' or 'O').

If an invalid letter is entered, the user will be prompted again to choose a location.

After the first player marks their choice, the second player will be prompted to do the same.

# Rules

A player will win if they manage to place three of their markers ('X' or 'O') in a row either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

The game will end in a tie if all nine board locations are filled and neither player has fullfilled the requirements to win.
